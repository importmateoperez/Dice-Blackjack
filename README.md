# Dice-Blackjack
This game is very similar to blackjack however, two six-sided dice are being 
rolled. The rules are the same as they are in blackjack with the exception of 
standing on 17. Each roll you do, the computer also rolls. You will not know
The computers number at any point, thats the gamble! 
This is my first project dealing with java OOP concepts. I have done projects
in the past but I did not have a full understanding of what I was doing or
how the objects worked. I will later make a money system with betting. I will
also later upgrade this game with JavaFX and make a GUI based game instead of
a CLI based game.
